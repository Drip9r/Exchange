## Welcome To Exchange!
What is Exchange? Exchange is a script hub on roblox.
Exchange requires an Executor Level 5+
Exchange contains scripts from many creators and does not
claim their work as ours.

## How to Use?
To use Exchange you must execute the launcher with a 'Compatible Executor'.
Since the programs inside the script hub is not mine. I cannot ensure if it has game protection.

## Security
To make sure Exchange is updated it pings github for json data.
If everything checks out then it will execute the actual script hub.

## Credits
All the creators have their information on a pane.
To see this information you can hover over any script and it will show you the name of the creator and a discord if provided.

The 'Launcher' & 'Hub' are heavily inspired by [EzHub, EzLauncher](https://github.com/debug420/Ez-Hub). Their design looked very simple and clean so I recreated it to my best ability.
